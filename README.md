# Can dzteeth fit in your project? Absolutely. 
dzteeth is a tiny js library that makes working with dental diagrams easy

Library consists of 2 main components:
```js
dzteeth.render_adult_teeth() // shows a interactive diagram for an adult person
dzteeth.render_child_teeth() // shows a interactive diagram for a child
```

You can also configure colors for every tooth problem you can have, as well as, number of problems you want to show on the screen.
